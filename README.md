Hey there! This website is the frontend of HackLumina'25.

OKK But what is hacklumina?????   
yeah yeah, hacklumina is an exciting 36-hour long hackathon in May 2025 in Delhi/NCR region. The hackathon is open to all the high school coders, whether beginners or experts

The following website has the static frontend, but the query form at the bottom sends the payload entered in the form to an external REST api made with flask whose code is in the app.py file. After that the API sends the data to query slack channel of hacklumina team. Thus it works as a webhook. Video mentioned below is its visual representation.
